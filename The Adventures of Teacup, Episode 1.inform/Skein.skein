The Adventures of Teacup
Story time for Teira by Robert Haddon
Release 0 / Serial number 140113 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

You groan and rub open your eyes with both paws.   You discover that you are lying near a warm and furry lump in the corner of a strange room.  You have no idea how you got here or even where &quot;here&quot; is.

Your last memory is of  Ralph and you starting an investigation at an old building at the edge of Foxtown.  Speaking of Ralph, where is he?

You stand up and brush yourself off.  Satisfied that you have no broken bones or open wounds, it&apos;s time to find Ralph and figure out what&apos;s happening!

Small Room
This is a small room with no windows.  It is dimly lit from a grubby ceiling lamp high above your head and shines down on a dirty rug in the middle of the floor.  A doorway to the east is completely filled with a pile of rubble.

A dirty rug lies in the center of the room.  It&apos;s horrible looking and probably much worse to touch.  It looks quite thick and heavy, though with some help you could probably move it.

A rickety wooden desk with a single drawer sits in the northwest corner of the room.

The lump that you were lying near is here, moving up and down very slightly.  It might be alive!

&quot;Thank you, Teacup!&quot; Ralph says. &quot;What happened to us?  I don&apos;t remember anything.&quot;

Your snouts wrinkling in disgust, with Ralph&apos;s help you manage to slide the rug off to one side, leaving a trail of dirt and revealing a trap door in the floor!

(first opening the trap door)
You and Ralph put your backs into it and apply all of your combined canine power.  There is a loud snapping sound as rusted metal and old wood give way, causing the door to fly open and you and Ralph to tumble over backwards.
The trap door is now open!

Cellar
It is cold and damp here, there is just enough light coming from the room above to see that you are in a stone-walled cellar with exits to the north and south.  This place looks ancient, possibly unused for centuries.

Green slime drips from the cracks between stones.

Ralph arrives from above.

Old Storage Area
The stone-walled tunnel ends here, in what looks like an old storage area, based on the rotting crates lying about.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

There are some moldy wooden storage crates here.

Ralph arrives from the south.

This is a large open area stretching out in all directions as far as you can see, covered with grassy rolling hills and shallow valleys.  High above you is a bright ceiling, as if painted in light.  At the far end of this area you can see a gray rocky outcrop rising above the sea of green grass.  A trail through the grass leads off to the east.

This is a small room with no windows.  It is dimly lit from a grubby ceiling lamp high above your head and shines down on a dirty rug in the middle of the floor.  A doorway to the east is completely filled with a pile of rubble.

The lump that you were lying near is here, moving up and down very slightly.  It might be alive!

A dirty rug lies in the center of the room.  It&apos;s horrible looking and probably much worse to touch.  It looks quite thick and heavy, though with some help you could probably move it.

A rickety wooden desk with a single drawer sits in the northwest corner of the room.

A low, muffled sound is coming from the lump.

You shrug your haunches and continue anyway. &quot;What choice do we have?&quot; You ask.

Cave-In
It is hard to say how far south the old stone-walled tunnel once led, because at the south end of the room the roof has collapsed, making the way now impassible.  

The ground is shifting under your paws and your hackles are rising:  you sense danger here!

The whole room begins to shake violently!  You can&apos;t tell if it is an earthquake or if a bomb has gone off somewhere near by, but you have no time to think about it as the floor on which you and Ralph are standing suddenly collapses!  You slip off your feet and tumble into a huge crack that has opened underneath you.

During your tumble, you dropped everything you were carrying!

Thick dust is falling everywhere,  preventing you from seeing anything at the moment.

The dust finally settles enough for you to see where you are.

Dining Hall
This is an elloborately decorated room with rich wood paneling on the walls and a large wooden table in the middle surrounded by fancy chairs.  The west end of the room is a mess of debris from the recent disaster, covering half the table and some of the chairs.  Hanging from the ceiling is an iron chandalier, providing light. There is a doorway to the north and a tunnel leading east.  On the west wall hangs a large tapestry.

Ralph is here beside you, ready to follow your lead.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

Boooooom!!!
The whole room begins to shake violently!  You can&apos;t tell if it is an earthquake or if a bomb has gone off somewhere near by, but you have no time to think about it as the floor on which you and Ralph are standing suddenly collapses!  You slip off your feet and tumble into a huge crack that has opened underneath you.

During your tumble, you dropped everything you were carrying!

Thick dust is falling everywhere,  preventing you from seeing anything at the moment.

Dining Hall
This is an elloborately decorated room with rich wood paneling on the walls and a large wooden table in the middle surrounded by fancy chairs.

Before you can leave, Ralph grabs your shoulder. &quot;Teacup, listen!  Can you hear that?  Let&apos;s get out of here, now!&quot;
You shrug your haunches and continue anyway. &quot;What choice do we have?&quot; You ask.

Cave-In
It is hard to say how far south the old stone-walled tunnel once led, because at the south end of the room the roof has collapsed, making the way now impassible.  

The ground is shifting under your paws and your hackles are rising:  you sense danger here!

You can see a peanut here.

Boooooom!!!
The whole room begins to shake violently!  You can&apos;t tell if it is an earthquake or if a bomb has gone off somewhere near by, but you have no time to think about it as the floor on which you and Ralph are standing suddenly collapses!  You slip off your feet and tumble into a huge crack that has opened underneath you.

During your tumble, you dropped everything you were carrying!

Thick dust is falling everywhere,  preventing you from seeing anything at the moment.

Dining Hall
This is an elloborately decorated room with rich wood paneling on the walls and a large wooden table in the middle surrounded by fancy chairs.  The west end of the room is a mess of debris from the recent disaster, covering half the table and some of the chairs.  Hanging from the ceiling is an iron chandalier, providing light. There is a doorway to the north and a tunnel leading east.  On the west wall hangs a large tapestry.

Ralph is here beside you, ready to follow your lead.

Your glowing mushroom is definitely getting darker!  Perhaps you can find another one or somehow replant this one?

Looking closer at the lump, you realize it is your best friend Ralph curled up asleep!  You wake him up and he slowly comes around.

Old Storage Area
The stone-walled tunnel ends here, in what looks like an old storage area, based on the rotting crates lying about.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

There are some moldy wooden storage crates here.

&gt;[2] push rug
Your snouts wrinkling in disgust, with Ralph&apos;s help you manage to slide the rug off to one side, leaving a trail of dirt and revealing a trap door in the floor!

&gt;[3] open door
You and Ralph put your backs into it and apply all of your combined canine power.  There is a loud snapping sound as rusted metal and old wood give way, causing the door to fly open and you and Ralph to tumble over backwards.
The trap door is now open!

Cellar
It is cold and damp here, there is just enough light coming from the room above to see that you are in a stone-walled cellar with exits to the north and south.  This place looks ancient, possibly unused for centuries.

Green slime drips from the cracks between stones.

Ralph arrives from the north.

&gt;[8] go south

Before you can leave, Ralph grabs your shoulder. &quot;Teacup, listen!  Can you hear that?  Let&apos;s get out of here, now!&quot;
You shrug your haunches and continue anyway. &quot;What choice do we have?&quot; You ask.

Cave-In
It is hard to say how far south the old stone-walled tunnel once led, because at the south end of the room the roof has collapsed, making the way now impassible.  

The ground is shifting under your paws and your hackles are rising:  you sense danger here!

You can see a peanut here.

Ralph arrives from the north.

&gt;[9] get peanut
Taken.

Boooooom!!!
The whole room begins to shake violently!  You can&apos;t tell if it is an earthquake or if a bomb has gone off somewhere near by, but you have no time to think about it as the floor on which you and Ralph are standing suddenly collapses!  You slip off your feet and tumble into a huge crack that has opened underneath you.

During your tumble, you dropped everything you were carrying!

Thick dust is falling everywhere,  preventing you from seeing anything at the moment.


Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can&apos;t see a thing.

&gt;[10] z
Time passes.

The dust finally settles enough for you to see where you are.

Dining Hall
This is an elloborately decorated room with rich wood paneling on the walls and a large wooden table in the middle surrounded by fancy chairs.  The west end of the room is a mess of debris from the recent disaster, covering half the table and some of the chairs.  Hanging from the ceiling is an iron chandalier, providing light. There is a doorway to the north and a tunnel leading east.  On the west wall hangs a large tapestry.

Ralph is here beside you, ready to follow your lead.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

You can also see a peanut here.

This is a small room with no windows.  It is dimly lit from a grubby ceiling lamp high above your head and shines down on a dirty rug in the middle of the floor.  A doorway to the east is completely filled with a pile of rubble.

The lump that you were lying near is here, moving up and down very slightly.  It might be alive!

A dirty rug lies in the center of the room.  It&apos;s horrible looking and probably much worse to touch.  It looks quite thick and heavy, though with some help you could probably move it.

A rickety wooden desk with a single drawer sits in the northwest corner of the room.

A low, muffled sound is coming from the lump.
