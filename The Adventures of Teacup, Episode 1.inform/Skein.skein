The Adventures of Teacup
Story time for Teira by Robert Haddon
Release 0 / Serial number 140114 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

You groan and rub open your eyes with both paws.   You discover that you are lying near a warm and furry lump in the corner of a strange room.  You have no idea how you got here or even where &quot;here&quot; is.

Your last memory is of  Ralph and you starting an investigation at an old building at the edge of Foxtown.  Speaking of Ralph, where is he?

You stand up and brush yourself off.  Satisfied that you have no broken bones or open wounds, it&apos;s time to find Ralph and figure out what&apos;s happening!

Small Room
This is a small room with no windows.  It is dimly lit from a grubby ceiling lamp high above your head and shines down on a dirty rug in the middle of the floor.  A doorway to the east is completely filled with a pile of rubble.

A dirty rug lies in the center of the room.  It&apos;s horrible looking and probably much worse to touch.  It looks quite thick and heavy, though with some help you could probably move it.

A rickety wooden desk with a single drawer sits in the northwest corner of the room.

The lump that you were lying near is here, moving up and down very slightly.  It might be alive!

Underground Park
This is a large open area stretching out in all directions as far as you can see, covered with grassy rolling hills and shallow valleys.  High above you is a bright ceiling, as if painted in light.  At the far end of this area you can see a gray rocky outcrop rising above the sea of green grass.  A trail through the grass leads off to the east.

A glowing mushroom is here.

There are cages here, in which you can see some bones.

You can also see an office door here.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can&apos;t see a thing.

Underground Park
This is a large open area stretching out in all directions as far as you can see, covered with grassy rolling hills and shallow valleys.  High above you is a bright ceiling, as if painted in light.  At the far end of this area you can see a gray rocky outcrop rising above the sea of green grass.  A trail through the grass leads off to the east.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

You can also see Ralph here.

Abandoned Zoo
Here you see silver cages on display, resting on raised platforms.  It looks like some sort of zoo.  Whatever creatures were here died long ago, because there are only bones in the cages now.  To the west you can see the grassy area, and on the north wall there is a doorway.

There are cages here, in which you can see some bones.

You can also see an office door here.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can&apos;t see a thing.

Underground Park
This is a large open area stretching out in all directions as far as you can see, covered with grassy rolling hills and shallow valleys.  High above you is a bright ceiling, as if painted in light.  At the far end of this area you can see a gray rocky outcrop rising above the sea of green grass.  A trail through the grass leads off to the east.

You can see a super mushroom (providing light) and Ralph here.

Underground Park
This is a large open area stretching out in all directions as far as you can see, covered with grassy rolling hills and shallow valleys.  High above you is a bright ceiling, as if painted in light.  At the far end of this area you can see a gray rocky outcrop rising above the sea of green grass.  A trail through the grass leads off to the east.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

Old Storage Area
The stone-walled tunnel ends here, in what looks like an old storage area, based on the rotting crates lying about.

A glowing mushroom is lying here.

There are some moldy wooden storage crates here.

Ralph arrives from the south.

There are some ancient storage crates here.

You can also see a glowing fungus (providing light) here.

Cellar
It is cold and damp here, there is just enough light coming from the room above to see that you are in a stone-walled cellar with exits to the north and south.  This place looks ancient, possibly unused for centuries.  Green slime drips from the cracks between stones.

Green slime grows between the stone cracks here.

Before you can leave, Ralph grabs your shoulder. &quot;Teacup, listen!  Can you hear that?  Let&apos;s get out of here, now!&quot;
You shrug your haunches and continue anyway. &quot;What choice do we have?&quot; You ask.

Cave-In
It is hard to say how far south the old stone-walled tunnel once led, because at the south end of the room the roof has collapsed, making the way now impassible.  

The ground is shifting under your paws and your hackles are rising:  you sense danger here!

You can see a peanut here.

Boooooom!!!
The whole room begins to shake violently!  You can&apos;t tell if it is an earthquake or if a bomb has gone off somewhere near by, but you have no time to think about it as the floor on which you and Ralph are standing suddenly collapses!  You slip off your feet and tumble into a huge crack that has opened underneath you.

During your tumble, you dropped everything you were carrying!

Thick dust is falling everywhere,  preventing you from seeing anything at the moment.


Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can&apos;t see a thing.
